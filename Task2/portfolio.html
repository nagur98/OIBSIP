              <p class="about">
                My name is Nagur Vali Dudekula. I graduated from R.V.R & J.C College Of Engineering a month ago. Now, I am looking for my first full-time job. 
                I have been working as a freelance web developer for the last three years and cooperated with several startups.
                I cannot say with 100% confidence where I see myself in five years or what my big career goal is. 
                The world is changing rapidly, and I donâ€™t have enough professional experience to be certain about such things.
                However, I know that I can provide a fresh take and an extraordinary approach to every project.
                I am always open to challenges and constructive feedback. I am open-minded and learn new things quickly.
                I want to become a team player and dedicate all my skills and talents to develop high-quality and unique products.
